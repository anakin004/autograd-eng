== educational project

Based on Andrej Karpathy lecture on the basis of neural networks from the ground up
-- includes Value Nodes for weights, biases, reslults etc
-- visualization of backprop and neural network nodes and operations that results in a specific node
-- includes stochastic gradient descent for all nodes
-- uses gradient descent to change weights and biases based on the nodes current gradient
-- after passes the neural nets results approach intended data

-- here are some awesome practices regarding topics in this project

-- this demo and other visualizations in the jupyter notebook file use graphviz which I highly recommend checking out in the project reqs
-- this image is a visualization of the calculation of the loss function and setting gradients using backprop
